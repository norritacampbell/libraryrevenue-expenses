# libraryrevenue-expenses
This dataset was created as a result of a project for a Data Curation class at the University of Washington's iSchool. It is mainly concerned with the revenue vs. the expenditures of various public libraries across five different cities in California: Camarillo, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Bernadino. It looks at the cost of maintenance and upkeep, especially where collection maintenance and acquisition is concerned, as well as the cost of paying the staff that works at these libraries.
